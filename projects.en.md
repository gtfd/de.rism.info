# Current and ongoing projects


The German RISM national group works mainly on cataloging music manuscripts. In the course of work on individual collections, staff also check whether sources are present that were not included in previous catalogs of printed works (printed music, treatises, librettos). These sources are either cataloged in the RISM online catalog or noted internally at the RISM offices.

Here you can read more information about collections currently being cataloged as well as other projects and partnerships.
