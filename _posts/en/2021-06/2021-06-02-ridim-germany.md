<!-- Excerpt from: Schembartbuch, Hs 5664, fol. 59r, URI: http://dlib.gnm.de/item/Hs5664/129, Germanisches Nationalmuseum -->

The new website of RIdIM Germany (Répertoire International d’Iconographie Musicale) launched on 26 April 2021 and can be found at [http://ridim.musiconn.de](http://ridim.musiconn.de). Prior to this, as part of the second project phase of the DFG-funded Fachinformationsdienst (FID) Musikwissenschaft, the design and functionality of the RIdIM website and the web-based RIdIM database "Music and Dance in Art" were modernized, including adapting them for mobile devices. Technical support and maintenance of the website and the search are provided by the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.

The web application has an advanced search to facilitate online research of RIdIM Germany's records and it links to authority records in the GND and VIAF. With the relaunch of the site, the database was updated to include ca. 20,900 descriptions of music and dance depicted on art and handicrafts, supplemented by ca. 4,100 images and links to digital collections of museums and libraries.
